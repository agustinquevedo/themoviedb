# Monstarlab Fronted Test

Code Test
A fictitious client called MovieDB has tasked us to build a web app where their users are able to search for films, see details, favorite, etc.


## Demo

https://agustinquevedo.github.io/themoviedb


## Author

## Requeriments

1) Film search (using this API endpoint https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=4cb1eeab94f45affe2536f2c684a5c9e&query=<search_query>; (GET)), display the films in whatever UI you want.
2) The user should be able to see the details of the film (endpoint https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/?api_key=4cb1eeab94f45affe2536f2c684a5c9e (GET)).
3) The user should be able to favorite and unfavorite a movie (use whatever local storage that you think makes sense).
4) The user should be able to see a list of favorite movies (and from there go to the detail movie screen).

You can use either ReactJS, VueJS, or AngularJS, any UI, make as many or little comments you like, just remember that we will be looking through the code and want to get a good understanding of your skills. The code should be uploaded to Github or zipped and sent back. We should, as a minimum, be able to run the web app in the browser.
